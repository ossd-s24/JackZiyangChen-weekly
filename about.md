Greetings! My name is Jack Chen, and I am a junior at NYU majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and Business Studies. I am currently taking this class because I am really interested in the concept of open source and I want to leverage this course as an opportunity to contribute more to more projects in general. Outside of the classroom, I currently run a tutoring/edtech startup called [albuddy](https://www.albuddy.com). I am also an avid guitar player and a huge fan of the football team Bayern Munich!
