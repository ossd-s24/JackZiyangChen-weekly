This week marks the first full week that my group and I are working together on Speicetify, an open source project that aims to provide a better Spotify experience. I am very happy to see that we have already established a working routine and we are making good progress on our contributions to the project. Not only were we able to get in contact with the project maintainers, but we are also able to complete two to three PRs which have been merged into the codebase already. I think the next step for our group is to start making technical contributions, as our previous contributions were mostly open source related. During this week's discussion, we have decided that we want to put a bigger emphasis on new features within the project's ecosystem. Specifically, we would like to implement a new extension and a new theme. We have already started drawing up a design and feature requirements for the new extension, and we hope to finalize these and start working on the extension itself in the coming week.
